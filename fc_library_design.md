# Function Cloud (FC) Library Design Specification

## Overview

Function Cloud (FC) is a Python library that allows developers to easily deploy functions to the cloud using Modal.com's infrastructure. By simply wrapping functions with the FC decorator, they become remotely callable via generated URLs, with minimal configuration and setup.

## Core Features

1. **Simple Function Wrapping**: Deploy any Python function to the cloud with a simple decorator syntax
2. **Automatic URL Generation**: Each deployed function gets a unique endpoint URL
3. **Support for Multiple Function Types**:
   - Synchronous functions
   - Asynchronous functions
   - Class methods
   - API endpoints
4. **Token-based Authentication**: Secure deployment and function calls
5. **Intelligent Dependency Management**: LLM-powered analysis of function dependencies
6. **Environment Configuration**: Automatic container setup for function execution

## System Architecture

### Components

#### 1. Core FC Wrapper
The primary interface users interact with. Provides decorators for functions and methods.

#### 2. Authentication Manager
Handles token storage, validation, and secure communication with Modal.

#### 3. Dependency Analyzer
Scans function code to determine required packages and dependencies.

#### 4. LLM Integration
Uses machine learning to improve dependency detection and generate appropriate Modal configurations.

#### 5. Deployment Manager
Handles the process of deploying functions to Modal's infrastructure.

#### 6. URL Manager
Generates, stores, and manages function URLs for easy access.

## User Workflow

1. **Setup**:
   - Install the FC library: `pip install function-cloud`
   - Authenticate with a token: `fc.configure(token="your_modal_token")`

2. **Function Deployment**:
   - Decorate functions with `@FC.function`
   - Decorate class methods with `@FC.method`
   - Decorate API endpoints with `@FC.endpoint`

3. **Usage**:
   - Call `get_url()` on decorated functions to retrieve their cloud URLs
   - Use these URLs to make HTTP requests to your deployed functions
   - Results are returned as JSON or appropriate data formats

## Technical Details

### Decorator Implementation

The FC decorator transforms functions by:
1. Analyzing their code and dependencies
2. Creating a Modal-compatible wrapper
3. Deploying to Modal's infrastructure
4. Generating a callable URL

### Dependency Management

The system uses a two-step approach for dependency analysis:
1. **Static Analysis**: Examines imports and code structure
2. **LLM Enhancement**: Uses machine learning to identify complex dependencies and generate appropriate configuration files

### Authentication Flow

1. Developer provides token during library import or configuration
2. Token is securely stored for the session
3. All communications with Modal API use this token
4. Function endpoints can be configured to require authentication tokens

### State Management

For stateful services (e.g., classes):
1. Instance variables are serialized between calls
2. State is preserved in Modal's infrastructure
3. TTL (Time To Live) settings can be configured

## API Reference

### Main Decorators

```python
# Function decorator
@FC.function
def my_function(x, y):
    return x + y

# Class method decorator
class MyService:
    @FC.method
    def process_data(self, data):
        return data.upper()

# API endpoint decorator
@FC.endpoint(methods=["GET", "POST"])
def api_handler(request):
    return {"status": "success", "data": request.json}
```

### Configuration

```python
# Initial setup with token
FC.configure(token="your_modal_token")

# Additional configuration options
FC.configure(
    token="your_modal_token",
    region="us-east",
    memory=1024,
    timeout=30,
    cpu=1
)
```

### URL Management

```python
# Get function URL
url = my_function.get_url()

# Call function via HTTP
import requests
response = requests.post(url, json={"x": 5, "y": 10})
result = response.json()  # {"result": 15}
```

## Security Considerations

1. All communication between the client and Modal is secured via HTTPS
2. Authentication tokens are never exposed in URLs or function code
3. Function inputs and outputs are validated to prevent injection attacks
4. Rate limiting is available to prevent abuse

## Error Handling

1. Deployment errors provide clear, actionable feedback
2. Runtime errors are captured and returned as structured error responses
3. Timeout and resource limit handling ensures functions operate reliably

## Performance Optimization

1. Cold start optimization for faster function initialization
2. Caching mechanisms for frequent function calls
3. Auto-scaling based on demand

## Future Extensions

1. WebSocket support for streaming data
2. Function composition for creating complex workflows
3. Dashboard for monitoring function performance and usage
4. Custom domain support for function URLs
